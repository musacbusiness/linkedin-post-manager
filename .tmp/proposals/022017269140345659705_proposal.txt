**Your hiring bottleneck isn't sourcing—it's the manual screening that kills your time between "apply" and "interview."**

You've already built the Retell agent, which tells me you understand the value of automating the qualification step. Now you need the connective tissue: webhooks that actually work, data flowing cleanly between systems, and logic that doesn't break when Indeed sends malformed data (and they will).

**Why I'm the right fit:**

I build business automation systems at ScaleAxis—not just workflows, but the operational logic behind them. I've integrated webhook-based hiring flows before, including handling the quirks of job board APIs and voice AI callbacks. The Indeed → Retell → Sheets → notification chain you're describing is straightforward for me.

**My approach:**

1. Map your exact trigger conditions for Retell calls (what "certain criteria" means in your context)
2. Build each flow with error handling and logging (so you can debug without calling me)
3. Document everything—you'll own this system, not depend on me

**Timeline:** 8-12 hours total, delivered within 5-7 days.

**Quick math:** If this saves you 30 minutes per applicant and you process 50/month, that's 25 hours back. System pays for itself in month one.

**Question:** What's the volume of Indeed applications you're expecting weekly? That affects how I structure the Sheets monitoring.
