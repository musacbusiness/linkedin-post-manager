**Clean pipeline, no bloat — I get it.**

You've probably seen this before: someone overcomplicates a simple form-to-database flow, adds unnecessary steps, and suddenly a 30-minute setup becomes a debugging nightmare. You want the opposite — data in, data out, zero missing values.

**Why me:**
I've built dozens of Tally → Make → Airtable pipelines for clients. This exact stack. The common failure point isn't the tools — it's sloppy field mapping and not accounting for edge cases (empty fields, special characters, date formats). I build with those in mind from the start.

**My approach:**
1. Map every Tally field to Airtable columns (confirm data types match)
2. Build the Make scenario with error handling so you know if something breaks
3. Run 5+ test submissions covering normal inputs AND edge cases
4. Deliver a written summary you can hand to anyone on your team

**Timeline & Price:**
$300 fixed. Delivered within 24 hours of access.

**What you get:**
A pipeline that just works. No maintenance headaches. If a field changes later, the documentation makes updates trivial.

If this sounds right, send over access to the three tools and I'll have it live by tomorrow.
